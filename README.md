# 🧾 Simple Registration Form with Real-Time Validation

This project is a **responsive registration form** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It performs **real-time form validation** and disables the submit button until all fields are correctly filled.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time validation as the user types  
- 🚫 Submit button disabled until all fields are valid  
- ⚠️ Inline error messages for incorrect inputs  
- 💡 Responsive, clean, and minimal design

## 🧩 Validation Rules

| Field     | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Name**   | Cannot be empty | “Name cannot be empty.” |
| **Email**  | Must be in valid email format (e.g., user@example.com) | “Enter a valid email address.” |
| **Password** | Minimum length of 6 characters | “Password must be at least 6 characters.” |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the form  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Real-time validation logic  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The form listens for input events on the **Name**, **Email**, and **Password** fields.  
2. JavaScript checks the inputs in real-time:  
   - If any rule fails, an error message is displayed.  
   - The “Register” button stays disabled until all validations pass.  
3. Once all fields are valid, the “Register” button becomes active.  
4. On submission, an alert message appears confirming successful registration.
